Looking back, our project doesn't look very nice, and the code has a lot of repetition. At that time, we didn't fully understand the purpose of components and the importance of writing clean code. Now, after a year, I'm really surprised by how much I've learned. If I were to do a similar project today, I would approach it in a completely different way.
